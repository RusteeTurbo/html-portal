<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m someone who really enjoys the simple things: good food, a good swim, and solving problems in IT. 
  Whether I’m in the water or behind a screen, I like staying active and curious.
</p>

<p>I work in IT and enjoy balancing screen time with real-world pleasures like eating well and swimming whenever I can.</p>

<p>
Powered by good food, fresh water, and Wi-Fi. I’m in IT, I love to eat, and swimming is my go-to reset button.
If you want it more professional, funnier, or longer (like for a profile or intro), tell me where you’ll use it and I’ll tweak it.
